engineering application is large. However, the process of inversion is complicated dealing with various parameters and the uncertainty of the data caused by field conditions and human performance. One example is the dispersion of wave propagation in soil medium, there is not only one mode phase velocity dispersion curve, but multiple modes. The picking approach of dispersion curve has been considered to be highly objective, different people pick in different manner. The automated inversion algorithms are widely applied, but also very dangerous because of the complicated occurrence of higher-order modes and the argument of garbage in, garbage out.
